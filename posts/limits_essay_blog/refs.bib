    abstract = { Antiracist health policy research requires methodological innovation that creates equity-centered and antiracist solutions to health inequities by centering the complexities and insidiousness of structural racism. The development of effective health policy and health equity interventions requires sound empirical characterization of the nature of structural racism and its impact on public health. However, there is a disconnect between the conceptualization and measurement of structural racism in the public health literature. Given that structural racism is a system of interconnected institutions that operates with a set of racialized rules that maintain White supremacy, how can anyone accurately measure its insidiousness? This article highlights methodological approaches that will move the field forward in its ability to validly measure structural racism for the purposes of achieving health equity. We identify three key areas that require scholarly attention to advance antiracist health policy research: historical context, geographical context, and theory-based novel quantitative and qualitative methods that capture the multifaceted and systemic properties of structural racism as well as other systems of oppression. }

 abstract = {Since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, various forms of employment discrimination have been prohibited by law. The courts have enforced these laws vigorously, often requiring plaintiffs and defendants to present quantitative analyses of applicant and employee records as evidence. In fact, statistical analyses have become a regular feature of employment discrimination cases. Consequently, there has been an explosion of interest in the production of statistical assessments of discrimination, as more and more social scientists and statisticians have become involved as consultants and expert witnesses on both sides of discrimination cases. This paper discusses current practices in the production of statistical assessments of discrimination and suggests nonstatistical techniques that can be used to aid the interpretation of the results of statistical analyses. Statistical assessments (1) may contradict accumulated social scientific knowledge about decision making, in general, and discrimination, in particular, and (2) may also contradict the spirit of civil rights legislation concerning discrimination. These shortcomings motivate the introduction of a method of analysis that incorporates principles of Boolean algebra, an approach that allows holistic comparison of categories of similarly situated individuals.},

abstract = {Aims and objectives To examine discrimination and resilience experiences of people who identify as transgender and establish potential health service responses. Background People who identify as transgender face many challenges in society in terms of the knowledge, understanding and acceptance of a person's gender identity. Design A narrative review of quantitative empirical research. Methods A comprehensive search of CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Sociological Abstracts electronic databases from 2006â€“2016 was conducted. Results The search yielded 1,478 papers and following the application of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria a total of 19 papers were included in the review. The findings reveal that there is a need to ensure that the needs of transgender people are represented, fully integrated and clearly linked to outcomes that improve their health and quality of life. Conclusions Discrimination experiences can result in poorer health outcomes; however, many people have developed resilience and positive coping strategies. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses need to recognise and respond appropriately to the care and treatment needs of this population. Comprehensive nursing assessments and plans of care that encompass all aspects of the person should be in place supported by clear policy guidelines and evidence-based research. The education requirements of practitioners are outlined.},
