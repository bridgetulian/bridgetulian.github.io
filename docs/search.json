    "text": "Here is a link to my source code on the GitHub repo perceptron.py.\nThe perceptron update is done in my perceptron.fit() function, in which I begin by modifying the features matrix X by adding a row of ones to the features matrix to ensure that the bias is taken into account in the update (as w tilde is a vector of the weights and the bias). The function begins by assigning a random weight vector, then entering into a loop as long as the maximum steps. In this loop, a random index is chosen and then the point from that index as well as its feature vector are entered into a weight update equation which updates the weight if the predicted label and actual label are different. This for loop also keeps track of the score (accuracy) throughout the iterations.\n# Experimentation ## Experiment: Linearly Separable\nThe first experiment I ran had to do with linearly separable data, to ensure that the line converges. I created a perceptron object and ran my perceptron.fit function on that object, and the line did end up converging. I printed out my accuracies, and they fluctuated (albeit barely). The accuracy did end up reaching 1.0, proving line convergence. This code (and output) can be observed below.\n\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\nfrom perceptron import Perceptron\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n\nnp.random.seed(12345)\n\nn = 100\np_features = 3\n\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1.7, -1.7), (1.7, 1.7)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X, y, max_steps=1000)\n\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n  x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n  y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n  plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(p.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\nThe autoreload extension is already loaded.

Indeed, when the data was not linearly separable (as seen below), the line did not converge and the accuracy never reached 1.0. I utilized the make_circles function from sklearn.datasets to create my non linearly separable data, and the accuracy ended up (after max_steps equal to 1000) at 0.53.\n\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\nfrom perceptron import Perceptron\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_circles\n\nnp.random.seed(12345)\n\nn = 100\np_features = 3\n\nX, y = make_circles(n_samples = 100, noise = 0.5)\n\n#X, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1.7, -1.7), (1.7, 1.7)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\np = Perceptron()\np.fit(X, y, max_steps=1000)\n\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max):\n  x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n  y = -(w[0]*x + w[2])/w[1]\n  plt.plot(x, y, color = \"black\")\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nfig = draw_line(p.w, -2, 2)\n\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\nThe autoreload extension is already loaded.

(this is specific to my implementation of the algorithm, where I am looking at accuracy / adding the score to a property history for th perceptron). The runtime is going to be O(max_steps * n) where n is the number of data points. the for loop iterates through the specified number of max_steps, but everything within that for loop (other than the calculation of the score) is O(1). The calculation of the score is O(n), because the score predicts a label for each of the data points. Therefore, within the for loop, the runtime is O(n), making the total runtime O(max_steps * n)."

The syntax for writing math is very similar to the syntax used in the \\(\\LaTeX\\) markup language. For example, $f(x) \\approx y$ renders to \\(f(x) \\approx y\\). To place complex mathematical expressions on their own lines, use double dollar signs. For example, the expression\n$$\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2$$\nrenders to:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2\\;.\\]\nBehind the scenes, math is powered by the MathJax engine.

The function begins by assigning a random weight vector, then entering into a loop as long as the maximum steps. In this loop, a random index is chosen and then the point from that index as well as its feature vector are entered into a weight update equation which updates the weight if the predicted label and actual label are different. This for loop also keeps track of the score (accuracy) throughout the iterations."

    "text": "Runtime Complexity of a Perceptron Update\nThe runtime complexity of a single iteration of the perceptron algorithm update is dependent on the number of data points n, but not on the number of features p (this is specific to my implementation of the algorithm, where I am looking at accuracy / adding the score to a property history for th perceptron). The runtime is going to be O(max_steps * n) where n is the number of data points. the for loop iterates through the specified number of max_steps, but everything within that for loop (other than the calculation of the score) is O(1). The calculation of the score is O(n), because the score predicts a label for each of the data points. Therefore, within the for loop, the runtime is O(n), making the total runtime O(max_steps * n)."
